# RetailPilot: AI-Powered Shop Management

RetailPilot is a modern, lightweight shop management application designed for small retail businesses. It simplifies inventory, billing, and customer/supplier management, offering a clean user interface and a powerful AI chatbot for natural language-based operations.

This project is built as a simpler, more intuitive alternative to complex ERPs, with an initial focus on the needs of a small retail shop (e.g., a Saree shop), but is generic enough for many small businesses.

## üåü Key Features

*   **üì¶ Inventory Management:** Track products, stock levels, purchase/selling prices (both retail & wholesale), and receive low-stock alerts.
*   **üßæ Billing & Invoicing:** Easily create, manage, and print professional Sales Invoices and log Purchase Bills.

## üí¨ The Chatbot Advantage

The standout feature of RetailPilot is its integrated LLM-powered chatbot. Instead of navigating menus and filling out forms, you can manage your entire shop using simple, natural language commands.

### Example Chatbot Commands:

> `"Create a new sales invoice for customer 'Rajesh Kumar' with 2 'Kanjivaram Silk' sarees."`

> `"What is the outstanding balance for 'Anjali Traders'?"`

> `"Show me my top 5 selling items this month."`

> `"Add 50 pieces of 'Banarasi Georgette' to the inventory from supplier 'Surat Textiles'."`

> `"Which items are low in stock?"`

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file from the example
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file and add your configuration details:
    ```.env
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    SECRET_KEY="a_very_secret_key_for_sessions"
    LLM_API_KEY="your_llm_provider_api_key"
    ```

    **Run the backend server:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
    The backend API will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend (React):**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend

    # Install npm packages
    pnpm install
